    content: |-
      I am a graduate student in the Artificial Intelligence for Medical Systems Lab in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at OHSU. Currently, I am involved in two research projects: heart sound and murmur detection using phonocardiograms, and nocturnal hypoglycemia prediction.

      During my Bachelor's degree in Physics, I focused on learning machine learning and data science. Thus, I became passionate about data, which includes visualization, ETL (Extract, transform, load), and modeling. 

      As a Latin American Woman, I feel lucky to be where I am. However, I also feel a great responsibility to turn science into a multicultural space, reducing the gap between those who have access to it.
